# PowerShell-Atal
A PowerShell module to more easily automate ATAL sensor administration. The main reason for creating this was to automate and sync time (NTP) settings and the offset because of daylight saving. I ended creating multiple little scripts for various other purposes.

I have no affliation with ATAL other than being a customer of their sensors.
